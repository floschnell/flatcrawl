# flatcrawl

This repository is part of my **flatcrawl project**. This is the docker stack, that combines the functionality of the different modules (eg. crawlers, processors and routing) to deliver the combined functionality as a platform to the users. It is currently deployed to [my private cloud server](www.floschnell.de).

## The flatcrawl project

The purpose of the project is to **collect flats from different rental sites** and **expose them in a consistent shape**. Eventually it lets users define **custom searches** and provides them with **instant updates on new matching flats**.

**Clarification**: flats are *not* stored on the server. The purpose is not to create a competing portal, but to extend usability and help users find the right flat quickly by receiving updates from several sites without the hassle to setup and maintain different searches.
